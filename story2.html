        <h1>The Butterfly's Struggle:</h1>
        <p>A young boy found a cocoon with a struggling butterfly inside. Feeling sorry for the struggling insect, he decided to help it by carefully cutting open the cocoon. The butterfly emerged easily, but its wings were shrivelled and weak.


            The boy soon learned that the struggle to emerge from the cocoon is what gives the butterfly the strength to fly. By trying to help, he had unintentionally crippled it. The moral of the story: Sometimes, struggles are necessary for growth and strength.
