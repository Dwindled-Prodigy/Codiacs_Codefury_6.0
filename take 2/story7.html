        <h1>The Boy and the Starfish:</h1>
        <p>One morning, a boy was walking along the beach filled with starfish that had been washed ashore by the tide. He began throwing them back into the sea, one by one.


            A passerby asked, "Why bother? You can't save them all."
            
            
            The boy picked up another starfish and said, "I may not save them all, but I can make a difference for this one." The moral of the story: Every small act of kindness can make a big difference.
