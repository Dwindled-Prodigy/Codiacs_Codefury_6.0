        <h1>The Three Brothers:</h1>
        <p>Three brothers were given a task: to fill a room with as many goods as possible in one hour. The first brother bought expensive furniture, the second bought piles of clothes, and the third bought boxes of candles.


            When they returned, they found the room was pitch dark. The third brother, with the candles, said, "Let there be light!" His practical thinking outshone the extravagance of the others. The moral of the story: Practicality often beats extravagance.
