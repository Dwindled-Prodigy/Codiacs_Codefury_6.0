                <h3>Authors</h3>
                <p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ We are Darshan [L], Aniverthy [C], and Anika [R], the storytellers behind these tales that hopefully feel like a warm hug.

                    So, who are we when we're not busy spinning yarns? Well, first and foremost, you'll find us in a coffee shop. No, we're just kidding; we would never say something as corny ðŸ¤ª.
    
                    No, we're just kidding. So let's get into the fun things we love to do. We've always been a bunch of curious souls, forever seeking inspiration from the world around us. Whether it's a walk in the park, a chat with a stranger, or a quirky street sign, you can bet we'll find a story in it somewhere.
    
                    We are firm believers in the power of storytelling to inspire, connect, and heal. And that's what drives us to share these stories with you. We want them to be a cozy escape from the chaos of everyday life, like a friendly chat by the fireside.
    
                    When we're not lost in the world of words, we're probably exploring new places, trying out new hackathons (maybe or maybe not), or attempting adventures we never would've done if we were alone.
    
                    Thanks for stopping by, and we hope you enjoy the stories as much as we enjoy writing them. Feel free to drop us a line anytime; we'd love to hear from you!
                </p>
