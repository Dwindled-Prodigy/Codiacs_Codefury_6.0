        <h1>The Two Wolves:</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a wise old farmer. One year, a terrible drought hit the village, and the crops withered away. The other farmers panicked and gave up, but the wise old farmer kept planting his seeds, even though the land was dry.

            An old Cherokee chief told his grandson, "Inside every person, there are two wolves constantly at war. One's anger, envy, greed, and resentment. The other is love, compassion, kindness, and hope."


            The grandson thought for a moment and asked, "Grandfather, which wolf wins?"
            
            
            The wise chief smiled and said, "The one you feed." The moral of the story: Choose to nurture the positive aspects of yourself and others
            The Sun and the Wind:
            The Sun and the Wind were having a debate about who was stronger. To settle the argument, they decided to test their power on a traveler wearing a heavy coat.
            
            
            The Wind blew fiercely, trying to make the traveler remove his coat, but the harder it blew, the tighter the traveler clung to his coat. Then, the Sun gently radiated warmth, and the traveler willingly took off his coat.
            
            
            The moral of the story: Kindness and gentleness can often achieve more than force and aggression.
