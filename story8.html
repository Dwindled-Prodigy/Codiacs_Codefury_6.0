        <h1>The Bamboo and the Oak Tree:</h1>
        <p>A bamboo tree and an oak tree grew side by side in a forest. When a powerful storm came, the oak tree, being rigid and unyielding, was uprooted. The bamboo, however, swayed with the wind and remained standing tall.


            The bamboo said to the oak, "Flexibility is our strength. You must learn to bend without breaking." The moral of the story: Adaptability and flexibility are key to resilience.
