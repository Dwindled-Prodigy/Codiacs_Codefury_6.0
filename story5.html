        <h1>The Elephant and the Rope::</h1>
        <p>In a circus, there was a massive elephant tied to a small stake in the ground. Despite its size and strength, it never tried to break free. A curious bystander asked the trainer why the elephant didn't escape.


            The trainer explained, "When the elephant was young, we used the same size stake. At that age, it tried to break free but failed. Over time, it learned to believe it couldn't escape, so it never tried anymore." The moral of the story: Don't limit yourself based on past failures or false beliefs
