        <h1>The Fox and the Grapes:</h1>
        <p>A hungry fox saw a bunch of ripe grapes hanging high on a vine. He tried jumping but couldn't reach them. After many attempts, he gave up, saying, "Those grapes are probably sour anyway."


            The fox's sour grapes attitude helped him cope with his disappointment. The moral of the story: Sometimes, we belittle what we can't have.
